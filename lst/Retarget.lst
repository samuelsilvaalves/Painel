N    * arguments as pointers to the objects to receive the converted input. If
N    * there are insufficient arguments for the format, the behaviour is
N    * undefined. If the format is exhausted while arguments remain, the excess
N    * arguments are evaluated but otherwise ignored.
N    * The format is composed of zero or more directives: one or more
N    * white-space characters; an ordinary character (not %); or a conversion
N    * specification. Each conversion specification is introduced by the
N    * character %. For a description of the available conversion specifiers
N    * refer to section 4.9.6.2 in the ANSI draft mentioned at the start of this
N    * file, or to any modern textbook on C.
N    * If end-of-file is encountered during input, conversion is terminated. If
N    * end-of-file occurs before any characters matching the current directive
N    * have been read (other than leading white space, where permitted),
N    * execution of the current directive terminates with an input failure;
N    * otherwise, unless execution of the current directive is terminated with a
N    * matching failure, execution of the following directive (if any) is
N    * terminated with an input failure.
N    * If conversions terminates on a conflicting input character, the offending
N    * input character is left unread in the input strem. Trailing white space
N    * (including new-line characters) is left unread unless matched by a
N    * directive. The success of literal matches and suppressed asignments is
N    * not directly determinable other than via the %n directive.

N    *          even zero, in the event of an early conflict between an input
N    *          character and the format.

N    * A sequence of calls to the strtok function breaks the string pointed to
N    * by s1 into a sequence of tokens, each of which is delimited by a
N    * character from the string pointed to by s2. The first call in the
N    * sequence has s1 as its first argument, and is followed by calls with a
N    * null pointer as their first argument. The separator string pointed to by
N    * s2 may be different from call to call.
N    * The first call in the sequence searches for the first character that is
N    * not contained in the current separator string s2. If no such character
N    * is found, then there are no tokens in s1 and the strtok function returns
N    * a null pointer. If such a character is found, it is the start of the
N    * first token.
N    * The strtok function then searches from there for a character that is
N    * contained in the current separator string. If no such character is found,
N    * the current token extends to the end of the string pointed to by s1, and
N    * subsequent searches for a token will fail. If such a character is found,
N    * it is overwritten by a null character, which terminates the current
N    * token. The strtok function saves a pointer to the following character,
N    * from which the next search for a token will start.
N    * Each subsequent call, with a null pointer as the value for the first
N    * argument, starts searching from the saved pointer and behaves as

N     * Copies or moves a piece of memory from one place to another,
N     * with one-bit granularity. So you can start or finish a copy
N     * part way through a byte, and you can copy between regions
N     * with different alignment within a byte.
N     * 
N     * All these functions have the same prototype: two void *
N     * pointers for destination and source, then two integers
N     * giving the bit offset from those pointers, and finally the
N     * number of bits to copy.
N     * 
N     * Just like memcpy and memmove, the "cpy" functions copy as
N     * fast as they can in the assumption that the memory regions
N     * do not overlap, while the "move" functions cope correctly
N     * with overlap.
N     *
N     * Treating memory as a stream of individual bits requires
N     * defining a convention about what order those bits are
N     * considered to be arranged in. The above functions support
N     * multiple conventions:
N     * 
N     *  - the "bl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    byte, and consider the bits within each byte to be
N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion, so that the LSB comes
N     *    first. (For example, membitcpybl(a,b,0,7,1) would copy
N     *    the MSB of the byte at b to the LSB of the byte at a.)
N     * 
N     *  - the "bb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    byte, and consider the bits within each byte to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion, so that the MSB comes
N     *    first.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in big-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion.
